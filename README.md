## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Styling the document with CSS is what I've found more challenging. Some of the things I have learned are:
-centering an element on the screen;
-making the round corners of the flex box continue in the image, by using overflow:hidden;
-removing the space at the bottom of the image to make it fit in the container;
-the most challenging part has been adding the pink shade filter to the image. 


### Continued development

Continue practising HTML markup and CSS styling. Try CSS grid in the next project.
